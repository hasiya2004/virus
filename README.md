Examples of fake virus alerts
A fake virus warning can take on many forms. Familiarizing yourself with the following examples of fake virus warnings can help you spot the scams before they do damage.

Here are common examples of fake virus alerts:

Malvertisements
Malvertising happens when legitimate advertising networks are infected with malicious ads that can then show up on websites you otherwise trust. These ads often claim your device is infected with a virus, and then try to sell solutions that don’t work. If you see random notifications about malware infections, ignore them.

Fake versions of real ads
Counterfeits ads from legitimate companies can be very deceptive. And fake virus alerts can convincingly mimic actual notifications. But there are obvious signs you’re dealing with a fake. Look out for exaggerated, fear-mongering language or deals too good to be true.

A famous example is the Microsoft pornographic virus alerts. This fake Microsoft pop-up appears to lock your device due to “browsing unsafe pornographic websites.” The pop-up will include a phone number leading to a tech support scam that tries to sell you fake antivirus software to unlock your computer.

System tray notifications
System tray notifications are rarer than other fake virus warnings. They appear in your system tray as notifications informing you of an infection that requires immediate action. Fake system tray notifications are especially dangerous because of how convincing they appear. Before you interact with any notification, make sure it’s authentic.

Like other forms of fake virus alerts, you can check if these notifications are real by examining the language of the warning. These scams always use emotional language to scare you and trick you into making rash decisions. There’s also usually something wrong visually — mismatching fonts or formatting issues.
